Welcome to my actual decent-looking website project. I have learned the flexbox skills and spells from The Odin Project website. My deep gratitude to them.

In this project I will display and demonstrate the newly acquired knowledge and powers from TOP(The Odin Project).

Currently I do not have any ideas for the pictures, themes and general picture of the website's personality so it will look pretty boring. I may or may not come back to it in the future after I have finished it to edit it, add pictures, themes and fun stuff. But once I do I will add sources of pictures and resources here.

For now the first image in the first section is from a scene from Adventure time season 3 episode 16. 

Logo picture is wild berry princess from at, taken from fandom.

third picture aka hollow knight- art by syanart. I got it from displate
